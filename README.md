In this project I have created my own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV. To create this magical experience I have used an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation.

In order to run this code you must have the cloth of same color and no other color should be visible from that cloth. Here I took red color cloth. If you want to use the other cloths then you need to do some changes in the code.

Steps to run this project
1) Run the Background.ipynb file take the picture of the background without you in it.
2) Run the Harrypotter_cloak.ipynb file and I hope it works!!!
